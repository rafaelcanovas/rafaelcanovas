### Hello, how're you doing?

My name is Rafael, but you can call me Rafa. I'm a software engineer, leader and tech enthusiast from Brazil ðŸŒ´. I'm currently working at [Telavita](www.telavita.com.br), we create a lot of software for helping people overcome their emotional struggles. You can find [my dotfiles](github.com/rafaelcanovas/dotfiles), and some other open source projects here. Cya :)
