### Hello, how're you doing?

My name is Rafael, but you can call me Rafa. I'm a software engineer, [musician](https://open.spotify.com/intl-pt/artist/4bwXauSZTnrlZLw47HkDuD?si=FoQQ9SrOTC69BamIAx3oiQ), and tech enthusiast from Brazil. I'm currently working at [Indaband](https://inda.band), we are changing how people connect through music. Here you can find [my dotfiles](github.com/rafaelcanovas/dotfiles), and some other open-source projects. Cya :)
