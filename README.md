### Hello, how're you doing?

My name is Rafael, but you can call me Rafa. I'm a software engineer, leader and tech enthusiast from Brazil. I'm currently working at [<img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0114N6E74J/indaband/e5f349a2ccaef0ee.png" width="24" height="24" /> Indaband](inda.band), we are changing how people connect through music. Here you can find [my dotfiles](github.com/rafaelcanovas/dotfiles), and some other open source projects. Cya :)
