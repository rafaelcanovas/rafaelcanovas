### Hello, how're you doing?

My name is Rafael, but you can call me Rafa. I'm a software engineer, leader and tech enthusiast from Brazil 🌴. I'm currently working at [Indaband](inda.band), we are changing how people connect through music. Here you can find [my dotfiles](github.com/rafaelcanovas/dotfiles), and some other open source projects. Cya :)
